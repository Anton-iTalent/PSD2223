The following is what has been discuessed during out first group meeting:

- Since Erwin already figured out how to setup the python environment on his local, he will assisst Anton to setup the environment.
- Me and Up will try to come up with a structure/ plan of how to record our process  i.e. organize this group wiki.

For now:
