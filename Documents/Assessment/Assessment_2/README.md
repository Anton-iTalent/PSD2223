# Assessment 2: Risk and Test

This assessment has 4 main parts. Creating a risk registers description of each risk, the strategies to prevent it and the approach when risk happens. Then we will describe our pipeline design, a unit test plan including failure management, communication and result recording, and finally a review of testing framework and our choice of framework.
