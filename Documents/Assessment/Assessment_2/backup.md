## Risk review
Reviewing protential business, project and technical risks, the risk review table is derived together with all team member. This table aim to provide the potential solutions to prevent and solve the risk if it occurs. The table also include the chances of the risk occuring during our project.

## CI/CD pipeline

### Initial Setup and runner
We have set up a CI/CD pipeline in our repository and it is configured using the [tutorial provided by GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/).

CI/CD is enabled at the visibility, project features, permissions tab in project settings. Since GitLab runner is already installed in group's virtual machine(VM), only step is to register the VM as a runner using the instructions provided at [repository's CI/CD Settings](https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/psd2223/Patrick__Barrera_and_Collins/-/settings/ci_cd) at the runner tab.

Currently only one runner (named: s1754999\_VM) is registered with "docker" as the executor, which means the VM is processing jobs using a container. This choice is made because it is easy to setup and get running with a docker image that ensure a clean environment to run test, comparing to using shell.

We plan to create a custom docker image with all dependences installed, reducing the CI/CD minutes as much as possible.
 
Since there is only a single runner register for group's VM, Tags are not currently being used, which can be added to any runner by either at registration or editing the `config.toml` file as the project grows and there is a need for more runner.

### Pipeline
There are two main parts that are implemented into the pipeline:
- [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration)
- [Continuous Delivery](#continuous-delivery)

#### Continuous Integration
Two stages related to CI are currently deployed to our pipeline, which includes build and test. Note a before script is currently being used to install pytest, as a custom docker image has not been built.

Building stage is currently used to check Python, which output the pipleline.

Test stage currently includes two jobs, an echo job and a pytest job that are currently used to check the version of pytest to ensure it is available to use.

#### Continuous Delivery
Our pipeline currently is set up to echo only, but further in development the plan is to implement it to automatically delivery the project once all test cases are passed, this is done to ensure our code quailty throughout the development stage.

### Additional function
GitLab provides more functions that we would like to use, which has not been implemented into the pipeline at the current state of development, including test and pipeline recroding using artifact. They are convered in later section (see [Recording](#recording))

### Failure management 
In order to prevent errors from going forward unnoticed. Tests that can be automated will be implemented in CI/CD pipeline, where test will be ran on every commit.

When failure occurs, the team memeber(s) responsible should notify (e.g. create Agile issue) other team member and document the changes made and re-test accordingly. If upon reviewing the failure does not impact the project significantly, the team member should move on to another failure.

As failure occues, we will set up team meetings to define what classify as a failure, which we will document in the GitLab documents.

Depending on the circumstances, resources should be allocated, and the schedule should be adjusted to reflect the consequences of the failure.

### Failure communication
Depending of the scale of the impact the failure caused. The following group/personnel should be notified:

##### Developer (team member)
Failures that are spotted at development stage, team member(s) that are related to the development of the function(s) that are failing should be notify other team memeber and take appreciate actions.

This includes documentations and/or meetings with details of the impact the failure has cause to the project and what could be affect further in the project.

If the failure have significant impact on the deadline and budgets, the documents can be used by team memeber(s) and clients to make decisions of the furture development.

##### Client (End user)
Our team will inform the client on failure that has impact to the schedule and/or released product. Because failure are inevitable, we will discuess what features have to be cut to meet deadline with the client.

We will communicate with client via meetings and emails.

### Recording
We will be taking advantage of GitLab CI/CD, which includes ways to record failures,  includes:

##### Pipeline
Pipeline runs on every commit, and the test results of each jobs can be accessed via the GitLab repository, with well defined jobs the failure can be read from the job output.

##### [Job artifact](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/job_artifacts.html)
Artifact can be generated via pipeline's jobs, we will use it to store output of functions other than errors.

##### [Pipeline artifacts/ code coverage report](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/pipeline_artifacts.html)

GitLab provides [pipeline artifacts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/pipeline_artifacts.html) which can provide [test coverage visualization](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/testing/test_coverage_visualization.html) tool allowing collection of test coverage information or as a general coverage-analysis tool. We will use it to record and analyse test effectiveness, main .

## Review and choice of testing framework
We reviewd 4 popular testing framework for python, discusses their pros and cons and justifying the final choice of testing framework that best fit out test plan. The 4 frameworks are as follow:

1. [Robot Framework](#robot-framework)
2. [pytest](#pytest)
3. [PyUnit (unittest)](#pyunit-unittest)
4. [Nose2](#nose2)

### [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/)

Free, open-source test automation framework predominately used for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development. It requires Python version 3.6 or newer, and can be used on almost all platforms.

Pros: 
- Keyword-driven which are beginner friendly and allow users to easily create highly readable test cases
- Test data syntax can be easily used and combined
- Complete ecosystem consists of common tools and testing libraries, where function can be reuse in another project
- Rich built-in library offers many APIs and is highly extensible

Cons:
- Fixed form writing can lead to complexity when developing complex automation systems
- Hard to customize HTML report
- Robot Framework cannot run parallel tests without use of external tool (e.g. Selenium Grid)

### [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/)

Open-source Python-based unit testing framework. It requires Python 3.7 or newer. Easy to learn, and offers more features such as assertion rewriting comparing to PyUnit.

Pros:
- Informative test feedback comparing to PyUnit
- Test cases are fast and easy to write, compact (less boilerplate code), expressive and readable
- Functional modularization, help cover all parameter combinations without rewriting test cases
- Scalability, offers rich and useful plugins (e.g. pytest-xdist allows parallel tests without additional test runners)
- Values in test case are stored after test is complete, details on which value assertion failed and value was asserted are available

Cons:
- Uses special syntax which reduce test cases compatibility with other frameworks
- Can be overkill when developing simple test cases

### [PyUnit (unittest)](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyUnit)

Python standard unit testing automation framework. `unittest.TestCase` class provides special assertion methods, similar to Pytest. Using unittest-sml-reporting allows generation of XML reports.

Pros:
- Comes with Python standard library 
- Easy syntax and conventions suitable for beginners
- Individual test cases can be run easily, test outputs are concise flexible
- Fast test reports generation

Cons:

- Uses of snake\_case for (Python) and camelCase (JUnit) naming method still exists which can be confusing
- Test code can be difficult to read it becomes too abstract

### [Nose2](https://docs.nose2.io/en/latest/)

Support Python versions that are currently supported by the Python team. An extension of unittest, through plugins it add support for test execution and discovery, decorators, fixtures, parameterization, and more.

Pros:
- Can extend uinttest test case with nose2 functions
- Rich built-in plugins
- Allows parallel testing
- Automatic tests collection (Providing users follow  guidelines when organizing library and test code)

Cons:
- Documentation can be challenging to read
- No as actively maintained compares to other frameworks

### Choice and justification

At the current state of our development, we believe pytest is the best fit compare to other frameworks mentioned above. The 3 main reasons are as follow:

- Our group is familiar with the Python syntax, pytest uses a similar syntax that can reduce test cases development time
- Pytest is the most popular, many inforamtion are available online when debugging (e.g. stackoverflow) which can also lead to less development time
- Pytest has a richer test case output and more pulgins comparing to unittest
