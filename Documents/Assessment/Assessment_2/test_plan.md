### Usability and user acceptance test
Few aspect of the program, which including query/upload paper speed, GUI test (e.g. broken link, are buttons performing the correct task, results formatting), will be done manually by team member. For speed test, we will profiling the code and document the results, and apply changes.

Program usability test will be done via user testing. We will let potential users (e.g. students) to use our program and gather feedback via questionnaire. We will gather the results and plan changes with team member accordingly.

### Failure management 
In order to prevent errors from going forward unnoticed. Tests that can be automated will be implemented in CI/CD pipeline, where test will be ran on every commit.

When failure occurs, the team memeber(s) responsible should notify (e.g. create Agile issue) other team member and document the changes made and re-test accordingly. If upon reviewing the failure does not impact the project significantly, the team member should move on to another failure.

As failure occues, we will set up team meetings to define what classify as a failure, which we will document in the GitLab documents.

Depending on the circumstances, resources should be allocated, and the schedule should be adjusted to reflect the consequences of the failure.

### Failure communication
Depending of the scale of the impact the failure caused. The following group/personnel should be notified:

##### Developer (team member)
Failures that are spotted at development stage, team member(s) that are related to the development of the function(s) that are failing should be notify other team memeber and take appreciate actions.

This includes documentations and/or meetings with details of the impact the failure has cause to the project and what could be affect further in the project.

If the failure have significant impact on the deadline and budgets, the documents can be used by team memeber(s) and clients to make decisions of the furture development.

##### Client (End user)
Our team will inform the client on failure that has impact to the schedule and/or released product. Because failure are inevitable, we will discuess what features have to be cut to meet deadline with the client.

We will communicate with client via meetings and emails.

### Recording
We will be taking advantage of GitLab CI/CD, which includes ways to record failures,  includes:

##### Pipeline
Pipeline runs on every commit, and the test results of each jobs can be accessed via the GitLab repository, with well defined jobs the failure can be read from the job output.

##### [Job artifact](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/job_artifacts.html)
Artifact can be generated via pipeline's jobs, we will use it to store output of functions other than errors.

##### [Pipeline artifacts/ code coverage report](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/pipeline_artifacts.html)

GitLab provides [pipeline artifacts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/pipeline_artifacts.html) which can provide [test coverage visualization](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/testing/test_coverage_visualization.html) tool allowing collection of test coverage information or as a general coverage-analysis tool. We will use it to record and analyse test effectiveness, main .
